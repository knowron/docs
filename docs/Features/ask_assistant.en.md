## **Capabilities**

The **Ask Assistant** is designed to support you in the following ways:

### 1. **Guided Query Assistance**
When your question is unclear, the Assistant provides real-time feedback, suggesting how to refine your query for better results.  

- Example: If you ask, "How does this work?" the Assistant might prompt, "Could you specify which machine or process you are referring to?"

### 2. **Dynamic Examples and Follow-Up Questions**
The Assistant offers examples of well-structured queries to help you formulate your question more effectively, and you can ask follow-up queries to understand the topic you have doubts about better:

- Example Question 1: "What are the maintenance steps for the SMT Placement System?"
- Example Question 2: "Which cleaning liquid should I use for the maintenance?"

### 3. **Language Translation**
Queries and responses seamlessly cross language barriers, ensuring you receive relevant results even when the source content is in a different language.

### 4. **Knowledge Sources are Linked**
If infomation is retrieved from the knowledge base, the answer will have clear links to it and will display the necessary context and resources below the answer.

## **How to Use Ask Assistant**

### 1. **Start with Context**
Before asking your question, remember to mention the **product line** or **machine** relevant to your query and make it explicit you are looking for information about it. This helps narrow down the search and provides more accurate results, while a more general query will results in us looking accross all machines and product lines.

### 2. **Structure Your Query**
To get the best results:

- Be specific: Include details such as machine names, processes, or key terms.
- Use natural language: Write your question as if you were asking a colleague. This will help the system and provide better interactions.

### 3. **Refine and Iterate**
If the results aren't what you expected:

- Use the Assistant's suggestions to clarify or refine your query.

## **Tips for Effective Use**

### **1. Be Specific**
Instead of asking "How does this work?" try:

- "How do I calibrate the SMT Placement System for a new board?"
- "What are the troubleshooting steps for a misaligned conveyor belt in Line 3?"

### **2. Leverage Feedback**
If the Assistant suggests refining your query, consider adding details or clarifying terms to improve the response quality.

## **Feedback and Continuous Improvement**

Your feedback is essential for improving the Ask Assistant feature. If you find the results unhelpful or inaccurate:

- **Mark Results Not Helpful:** Share details about why the result didn't meet your expectations.
- **Downvote the Answer:** Provide specific feedback on how the answer can be improved.
- **Upvote Helpful Answers:** Let us know when the Assistant meets or exceeds your expectations.
