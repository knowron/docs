# AI-Powered Reports

AI-powered reports **significantly reduce the amount of time and effort necessary to fill out service reports**. Simply explain to KNOWRON app what you did like you would a co-worker and our AI will fill out the report for you. You can then check that everything is there, sign the report and submit it directly to your service manager, in the form of a .PDF. We will make sure you get a copy too.

In the future, your colleagues will be able to take a look at the report directly on their phones or their laptops to understand the service history of the machine. Collaborating has never been easier.

## For Technicians

- Scan the machine you want to submit a report for and navigate to the machine’s logbook. [Read this for more details](../logbook_na#how-to-get-started-with-the-machine-logbook).

- Tap on “New Entry” and select “Service Report”.

- Follow the on-screen instructions. You can record a voice note of up to 5 minutes. Try to be detailed so that the system has all the information it needs to fill out your report!

- Wait for our system to process your voice note and map it to the fields in the report.

- Check the report, sign it and submit it!

- You and your service manager will receive a copy of the resulting .pdf.

## For Service Managers

Service managers need to create **service report templates** that will be filled out by technicians on the field or on the shopfloor. Most service organizations already have service report templates they use.
