## What is KNOWRON?

Knowron is a personal assistant for deskless workers that boost their productivity from their first day on the job and which practically eliminates the tedious work of information search and report creation. Service organizations receive actionable insights about their products and processes to remove the guesswork from their after-sales operations.

## What is the process to get started? / How long does it take to implement? / How easy it is to adopt

To begin using KNOWRON, all you need to do is upload any technical documentation, reports, or manuals related to your equipment. In addition, our AI-powered assistant can also extract information from other data sources such as internal wikis and CRMs.

Once the information has been extracted, you can ask any questions related to the documents and start empowering your workforce around the clock.

## How does KNOWRON semantic search work?

Our system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to go beyond a simple keyword search and understand the context and meaning of the text. NLP is a field of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human languages. With NLP, our system can extract meaning from the text by breaking it down into information blocks and processing them in accordance with their neighboring blocks.

To achieve this, we utilize transformers, a type of machine learning model that has revolutionized the field of NLP in recent years. Transformers allow our system to not only understand individual words but also the relationships between them and the broader context of the text. This enables our system to provide more accurate responses and a more focused approach.

## How do you ensure the correctness of the answers given by the system?

At our core, we prioritize the faithfulness of our system, and we have developed various methods to ensure its accuracy. Firstly, our answers are generated exclusively from the context provided in the documentation. This prevents any errors or hallucinations that could lead to the delivery of inaccurate information to your workforce.

In addition to this, we have created a framework that allows our system to train itself based on usage. This enables us to fine-tune our results and provide more relevant answers for each specific use case.

Lastly, we also offer verified answers that have been approved previously, giving you additional confidence in the accuracy of the information provided. With our commitment to accuracy, you can be sure that KNOWRON is a reliable tool for your business.

## How do we collect data, and how do we deal with GDPR?

We take cybersecurity and data protection very seriously. We are compliant with GDPR, where we present a privacy notice in a concise and transparent manner. We ask for user consent before tracking, keep analytics anonymous and ensure encryption of all sensitive data. We believe building a robust privacy and security program is the first step to reinforcing customersâ€™ confidence in how we value, treat, and protect their data.

We are displaying our existing technical and organizational measures (TOMs) to our clients (upon request) and are reviewing them on a 6-month basis in order to ensure the list is up-to-date and comprehensive.

Only you and members of your team will have access to the documents you have uploaded. No other client or any user without the authorization can access them in any way shape or form. Your data is safe with us.

## Are there integrations available, and how do they work?

Our platform offers a REST API that allows developers to easily connect our system with other databases and software providers.

## Can I give access to third parties (Customers or partners)? / Who can use it in my organization? / Is there role management?

Yes, it is possible to enable external users to access your instance on KNOWRON in several ways.

Firstly, we offer user management tools that allow you to assign viewer and editor roles to individuals in your organization. These hierarchical roles help you to control access to information and maintain data security.

Additionally, we have implemented document access controls, which allow you to specify which user groups can access sensitive documentation. This provides an extra layer of protection for your confidential information.

Finally, for larger organizations that require a white-label application, we offer a service that allows you to brand the platform as your own and provide access to your customers. This service enables you to maintain a consistent brand presence and provide a seamless user experience for your customers.

Overall, we provide a range of options to help you manage access to your instance on KNOWRON and ensure that your data is protected.

## What languages are available?

Our software recognizes the importance of multilingual access for international workforces. Currently, we offer out-of-the-box access to English and German. To ensure seamless communication across different languages, we have enabled autotranslation of documents and our search functions. Furthermore, we understand the needs of our customers, and upon request, we have also developed Spanish and Chinese access on our platform. We are continuously working to expand our language capabilities to support more languages and cater to our global customer base.

## What kind of information is taken by the platform? / How is my information protected?

Our platform helps to enrich your knowledge base by incorporating technical documentation, reports, or manuals related to your equipment. We also offer the creation of troubleshooting and articles, which can be enhanced with videos and images to provide visual aid during the explanation of complex processes.

The desktop version requires an active internet connection at all times to access documents, articles, and tutorials.

## How well does speech work in noisy environments?

Our voice-to-text algorithm enables you to record your voice and create a transcript for the KNOWRON system. This works even in crowded and noisy environments. However, if multiple people are talking during the recording, the transcript may contain errors.

## How do I add product information?

To upload information about a product, you must first create a digital copy of it on our overview panel. To provide the system with relevant information, you need to upload specific manuals and service bulletins. Once the product is available on our overview, you can analyze the documentation related to a specific category of machines or equipment.

## Can questions be traced back to an individual and thus be problematic for the workers council?

Our platform does not have that capability. While we do keep a record of all the questions asked on the platform, we do not collect any personal data or means of identifying the individual who submitted the question. Our users' privacy is of utmost importance to us.
