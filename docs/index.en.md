The **KNOWRON Assistant** is a new system powered by Natural Language Processing that gives you access to the information about your plant or machine faster than ever before.

The pages below will give you an overview of the capabilities of the system. This page will be periodically updated, particularly when new features are added.

Our goals with this application are:

- Make you more efficient, on and off-site.
- Take away the tedious information lookup that is common in service organizations.
- Empower clients to ask questions to the system instead of saturating the support hotline.
- Free your time for the work that matters most!

You can always reach me under <arturo@knowron.com> if you want to know more or need any support. Talk to you soon!
