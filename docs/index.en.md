## Why should you use KNOWRON?

**A single source of truth for your service organization**

Are the assembly instructions for this machine on the service manual or on the user's manual you have printed out? Or was it on the training documentation on Sharepoint?

With KNOWRON, there's no question anymore - find everything in one place.

**Lightning fast access to your information**

Ask a question in your own words from your phone, laptop, or tablet and get the right answer, all in 5 seconds flat. KNOWRON frees your time for the work that matters most.

**KNOWRON answers your questions**

Whenever possible, we will try to formulate exact answers to the questions you're asking so that you don't have to look things up in dense documentation - our AI does it for you.

**Tutorials and troubleshooting to lighten the load**

You're an expert in your field, but a little help is always good. Follow step-by-step instructions with images and videos to make sure maintenance and repair processes are a breeze.

**Your questions reach the right person every time**

In the event you don't find anything that will help you do your job, your colleagues in technical documentation or first level support should find out so that it doesn't happen again. KNOWRON will let them know.

**Revolutionize Your Service Operations with Digital Twins**

Create digital twins of your factory layout with KNOWRON, ensuring all assembly line data is accessible from one place. Optimize efficiency with real-time access to machine documentation and seamless communication, enhancing operations and preventing unplanned downtime.

**Enhance Operations with a Digital Logbook**

The digital logbook allows users to create machine-specific entries, sharing text and video content with colleagues on the shop floor. Enable your team to stay informed about processes and maintenance through a digital twin, ensuring no information is lost in paperwork or shift changes. 

**Effortless Content Creation with Voice-Based Knowledge Capture**

The Voice Input feature is designed for blue-collar workers to enable hands-free data entry through accurate AI-driven voice technology. Integrating industry-specific templates, it streamlines the capture and documentation of field expertise.
