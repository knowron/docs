## Product Update on Control Suite: Introducing Ask Assistant, your conversational AI for targeted support

We‚Äôre excited to announce the introduction of **Ask Assistant**, a beta chatbot feature in Control Suite that brings a conversational approach to searching and accessing information. Designed with technicians in mind, this tool enhances efficiency by making it easier to retrieve precise information quickly and intuitively through natural dialogue.

### üí¨ Conversational Search for Streamlined Knowledge Retrieval

Ask Assistant leverages a conversational format to help users find information with greater focus and accuracy. Rather than scrolling through extensive manuals or documents, technicians can now engage in a back-and-forth conversation with Ask Assistant, providing context that sharpens each subsequent search. This feature allows users to keep track of what has been discussed previously, ensuring they stay on topic and can access relevant data without starting from scratch each time.

### üîç Efficient, Contextual, and Targeted Results

By retaining conversational context, Ask Assistant refines its responses based on what has been mentioned earlier in the conversation. This targeted approach to knowledge retrieval helps technicians zero in on the exact information they need, even in complex diagnostic or troubleshooting scenarios. With Ask Assistant, users save time and effort, enhancing productivity in fast-paced environments where accurate information is critical.
