# Introducing the KNOWRON Assistant

We’re excited to introduce the [KNOWRON Assistant](https://docs.knowron.com/Features/ask_assistant/), a brand-new feature that helps users find accurate and detailed answers to their questions more reliably than ever before. The KNOWRON Assistant will be the main way of interacting with KNOWRON for all users. More details can be found in the [documentation page](https://docs.knowron.com/Features/ask_assistant/).

The release of the KNOWRON Assistant will also allow us to release a much-awaited **refresh of our App** - more details about this will be released in the coming week.

This feature will be available to all clients **on calendar week 39 (the week of the 22nd of September)**.



## **🚀 The Vision Behind the Assistant**

We take our users' and stakeholders' feedback very seriously at KNOWRON. One of the most common requests we heard was the necessity to have a "smarter" system, which could handle follow-up questions and crucially, aid users to navigate to the information that they need. The Assistant does just that.

The KNOWRON Assistant is a powerful AI agent that can interpret a users' query and decide what [skill](https://docs.knowron.com/Features/ask_assistant/#skills) is needed to answer it best. It builds upon the powerful search engine users are accustomed to and adds brand new capabilities. Over time, we will continue to add new skills to the assistant, based on your needs and feedback.

</p>

Of course, the user always remains in the driver's seat. Users can select explicitly what skill they want to use or even if they want to opt out of the assistant and keep using the search they are used to.

## **✨ What’s New**

Ask Assistant is more than just search. It’s a **conversational AI copilot** designed to help you in multiple ways:

- **Chat naturally** – Ask questions in plain language and get clear, structured answers. Need it translated? Rephrased? Just ask for it.
- **Search with context** – The Assistant pulls from tutorials, documents, logbook entries, and expert answers; always with source references. The assistant uses the same powerful search you know in the background.
- **Find documents fast** – Need a specific conformity declaration or maintenance guide? Just ask, and the Assistant matches the right file instantly.  
- **Stay in your workflow** – Set the context by selecting your asset so results are laser-focused on what you’re working on.

## **🖥️ How It Works**

1. Go to the page of any asset: product or machine.

2. Make sure to toggle the question to "Assistant". Don't worry: we'll remember what you select.

    </p>


3. Ask your question like you would a coworker. That's it!

Alternatively, you can select the assistant icon on the navigation sidebar on the left.

## **📣 Roll out**

We are slowly rolling out this feature - initially, users will be able to select whether to ask the assistant or continue to the usual search screen. The default will continue to be the search, but we encourage users to try it out and give us feedback. 

Starting in the middle of October, the default for all users will be to send queries to the assistant. They will still be able to opt out - we'll remember their choice as well.
