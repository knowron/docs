## Introducing Ask Assistant, Context Filters, and Conversation Reset

Control Suite now includes an AI-powered assistant that turns every manual and log into an on-demand expert. This release also adds context filters so replies stay on topic, plus a one-click way to clear chat history when you switch tasks.

### 🤖 Ask Assistant: AI-Powered Answers on Demand

Type a question in everyday language. The assistant searches all documents, tutorials, and log entries you have access to and returns answers with clickable source links. Use it to translate text, draft emails, or troubleshoot equipment.

### 🔍 Context Filters: Precision Scoping in One Click

When you already know the asset or production line you’re working on, apply a filter before you ask. The assistant then limits its search to the selected context, reducing noise and boosting accuracy.

### 🔄 Conversation Reset and Feedback: Start Fresh Instantly or Teach the Assistant What Works

Press **New Conversation** in the chat header or refresh the page to erase previous context. Starting fresh prevents carry-over from earlier topics and keeps answers relevant. Additionally, every answer includes thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons. Up-vote helpful responses or down-vote those that miss the mark; your feedback improves future results.

## How to Get Started
1. Open **Ask Assistant** from the left-hand menu.  
2. *(Optional)* Set a context filter for a machine, line, or document type.  
3. Enter your question in natural language.  
4. Review the cited sources or continue the conversation.
