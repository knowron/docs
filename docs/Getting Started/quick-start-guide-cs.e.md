## What is KNOWRON?
KNOWRON is the personal assistant for blue collar workers. **We make organizational knowledge easy to access through one simple search interface.** This means that instead of searching in 4 or 5 different places for the information that you need to get your job done, you only need KNOWRON.

KNOWRON is available on your phone and on the web. This is the page for the web version of our product, the **Control Suite**. 

[You can see the Quick-Start Guide for the app version, the **KNOWRON Assistant**, here.](quick-start-guide-assistant.md)

## Why should you use KNOWRON?
**A single source of truth for your service organization**

Are the assembly instructions for this machine on the service manual or on the user's manual you have printed out? Or was it on the training documentation on Sharepoint?

With KNOWRON, there's no question anymore - find everything in one place.

**Lightning fast access to your information**

Take out your phone, ask a question with your own words and get the right answer, all in 5 seconds flat. KNOWRON frees your time for the work that matters most.

**KNOWRON answers your questions**

Whenever possible, we will try to formulate exact answers to the questions you're asking so that you don't have to look things up in dense documentation - our AI does it for you.

**Tutorials and troubleshooting to lighten the load**

You're an expert in your field, but a little help is always good. Follow step-by-step instructions with images and videos to make sure maintenance and repair processes are a breeze.

**Your questions reach the right person every time**

In the event you don't find anything that will help you do your job, your colleagues in technical documentation or first level support should find out so that it doesn't happen again. KNOWRON will let them know.

### 2. Selecting what knowledge base to access in the KNOWRON Control Suite

Once logged in, you will see an overview of the product lines that your colleagues have created.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/T7RuwXG.png" width="100%"></p>

**Product lines** represent the machines, plants or processes your organization supports which you work with every day. Product lines are there to give the KNOWRON system context - i.e. what are you asking questions about?

Before you continue, you have to select what product line you are interested in. You simply have to click on it and the context menu on the left of your screen will unfurl.

!!! tip "Asking questions will give you better results"

    KNOWRON uses state-of-the-art NLP to understand what you are looking for and bring up the most relevant results. If you formulate your query as a **question**, it will yield **better results**.

    > Example

    Instead of `printer humidity`, ask `In what humidity can the printer be used?`

Now all you have to do is ask what you want to know. Type in the search bar and press enter. KNOWRON will then go through your entire knowledge base and show you the most relevant results.

We can show you results from the following resources:

- Documents
- Tutorials
- Articles

In the future, we will also be able to show you results from your machine's logbook and much more!

Below is a sample search interaction for the question `In what humidity can the printer be used?`

### 4. Giving feedback in the KNOWRON Control Suite

KNOWRON can only get better if you give feedback! Feedback will be taken into account for the search algorithm and will even help your colleagues create better content for everyone in your organization.

You can give feedback in one of two ways:

**Use "thumbs-up" to mark results that helped you**

If you found a result that helped you, you can give it a thumbs-up (see below).

<p align="center"><img src="https://imgur.com/t2tkFxe.gif
" width="70%"></p>

A thumbs-up takes less than a second and it lets your colleagues know that this will be helpful to them too if they face a similar question. KNOWRON's algorithm will also take it into account: more thumbs-up reactions mean that this result will appear higher in search results in the future.

**Report any missing data for your colleagues to close the gap**

Sometimes, KNOWRON will not find a suitable answer - or the answer might be slightly off. This can happen particularly due to a very broad query or missing data.

If you find that the search results are not helping you in the way that you need, you can click on `RESULTS NOT HELPFUL` at the top of the search results and give us details on what you were expecting (see below).

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i44sdhx.gif
" width="70%"></p>

Your colleagues with an editor role, mostly from first-level support or hotline duty will act on your feedback and make sure that the information you need is available to you and your colleagues.
