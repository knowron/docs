## Step 1. Log into the Control Suite

The Control Suite is accessible under: [Visit the Control Suite](https://suite.knowron.com){ .md-button }

You only need your email and your KNOWRON password to log onto the system. Your **email** is normally your work email. You can find your **password** in the email you received inviting you to join your organization on KNOWRON (see below).

??? info "Need help finding your password or invitation email?"

    <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gXh9xJt.png" width="100%"><figcaption>This is where you find your password in the invitation email.</figcaption></p>

    If you do not remember your password, you can reset it right on [suite.knowron.com](https://suite.knowron.com). Simply click on "Forgot Password" and follow the instructions on the screen.

    If you have not received an email inviting you to KNOWRON, please contact your colleagues who are working with it or [request access here](mailto:ali@knowron.com?subject=Request for Access&body=Hi,%0D%0A%0D%0AI am unable to access the system. Please provide support.%0D%0A%0D%0AThank you!).

After you have your email and password, simply type them in and log in!

## Step 2. Select a product line

Once logged in, you will see an overview of the product lines that your colleagues have created.

**Product lines** represent the machines, plants or processes your organization supports which you work with every day. Product lines are there to give the KNOWRON system context - i.e. what are you asking questions about?

Before you continue, you have to select what product line you are interested in. You simply have to click on it and the context menu on the left of your screen will unfurl and you will be taken to the search screen.

## Step 3. Ask a question

Now all you have to do is ask what you want to know. Type in the search bar and press enter. KNOWRON will then go through your entire knowledge base and show you the most relevant results.

Below is a sample search interaction for the question `In what humidity can the printer be used?`

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/depHqSZ.png" width="70%"></p>

We can show you results from the following resources:

- Documents
- Tutorials
- Articles
- Expert Answers

In the future, we will also be able to show you results from your machine's logbook and much more!

!!! tip "Asking questions will give you better results"

    KNOWRON uses state-of-the-art NLP to understand what you are looking for and bring up the most relevant results. If you formulate your query as a **question**, it will yield **better results**.

    > Example

    Instead of `printer humidity`, ask `In what humidity can the printer be used?`

## Step 4. Give feedback

KNOWRON can only get better if you give feedback! Feedback will be taken into account for the search algorithm and will even help your colleagues create better content for everyone in your organization.

You can give feedback in one of two ways:

**Results not helpful**

Clicking on `Results not helpful` will trigger a window that allows you to specify the reason you believe the provided Generative Answer is incorrect.

 <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nImrevY.png" width="80%"></p>


You have the option to choose from the checkboxes provided by our team and/or add your own thoughts regarding the results to your query, suggesting ways for improvement. Our team will get back to you as soon as possible with a solution.

**Downvoting the Generative Answer**

Downvoting the Generative Answer will prompt a window that enables you to choose reasons from a list provided by our team, or you can submit your own explanation for why you believe the answer is not correct.
